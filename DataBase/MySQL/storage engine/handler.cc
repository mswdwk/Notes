/**
  The handler class is the interface for dynamically loadable
  storage engines. Do not add ifdefs and take care when adding or
  changing virtual functions to avoid vtable confusion

  Functions in this class accept and return table columns data. Two data
  representation formats are used:
  1. TableRecordFormat - Used to pass [partial] table records to/from
     storage engine

  2. KeyTupleFormat - used to pass index search tuples (aka "keys") to
     storage engine. See opt_range.cc for description of this format.

  TableRecordFormat
  =================
  [Warning: this description is work in progress and may be incomplete]
  The table record is stored in a fixed-size buffer:
   
    record: null_bytes, column1_data, column2_data, ...
  
  The offsets of the parts of the buffer are also fixed: every column has 
  an offset to its column{i}_data, and if it is nullable it also has its own
  bit in null_bytes. 

  The record buffer only includes data about columns that are marked in the
  relevant column set (table->read_set and/or table->write_set, depending on
  the situation). 
  <not-sure>It could be that it is required that null bits of non-present
  columns are set to 1</not-sure>

  VARIOUS EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL CASES

  f the table has no nullable columns, then null_bytes is still 
  present, its length is one byte <not-sure> which must be set to 0xFF 
  at all times. </not-sure>
  
  If the table has columns of type BIT, then certain bits from those columns
  may be stored in null_bytes as well. Grep around for Field_bit for
  details.

  For blob columns (see Field_blob), the record buffer stores length of the 
  data, following by memory pointer to the blob data. The pointer is owned 
  by the storage engine and is valid until the next operation.

  If a blob column has NULL value, then its length and blob data pointer
  must be set to 0.
