/*
  handlerton is a singleton structure - one instance per storage engine -
  to provide access to storage engine functionality that works on the
  "global" level (unlike handler class that works on a per-table basis)

  usually handlerton instance is defined statically in ha_xxx.cc as

  static handlerton { ... } xxx_hton;

  savepoint_*, prepare, recover, and *_by_xid pointers can be 0.
